Really. Why we need worldstates in WPF Application?

We need it in WinForms app, because it's one-threaded and we must process messages without interface lagging.
In WPF are 2 threads: for UI and for Core, so we won't get lag on UI during processing messages.

But I want to centralize processing of all messages like Logging and Settings.

I'll discuss it with NeoFBI.
